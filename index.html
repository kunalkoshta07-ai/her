              December brought us closer in ways I never expected. Late-night conversations at 3 AM, vulnerable confessions, playful banter that made me fall for you even harder.

              Christmas night. You were going through something difficult, something that scared you. I was at home, frustrated because I couldn't talk properly, couldn't be there physically. But I stayed up. I made sure you were safe. I worried about you like I've never worried about anyone.

That's what love is — it's staying even when you're exhausted, it's caring even when you can't do much, it's being there in every way possible.
